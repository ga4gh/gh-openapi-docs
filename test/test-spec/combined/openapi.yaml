    This is an **example** API to demonstrate features of OpenAPI specification

    # Introduction

    This specification is intended to to be a good starting point for describing
    your API in

    [OpenAPI/Swagger
    format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md).

    It also demonstrates features of
    [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo)
    tool and

    [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) documentation engine. So beyond
    the standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few

    [vendor
    extensions](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).


    # OpenAPI Specification

    The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,
    language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which

    allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities
    of the service without access to source

    code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly
    defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can

    understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
    implementation logic. Similar to what

    interfaces have done for lower-level programming, OpenAPI removes the
    guesswork in calling the service.

      Data sharing requires portable data, consistent with the FAIR data
      principles (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). Today’s
      researchers and clinicians are surrounded by potentially useful data,
      but often need bespoke tools and processes to work with each dataset.
      And today’s data publishers don’t have a reliable way to make their data useful to all (and only) the people they choose."
