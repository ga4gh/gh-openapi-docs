      This specification is intended to to be a good starting point for
      describing

      your API in [OpenAPI/Swagger
      format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md).


      It also demonstrates features of
      [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo)
      tool and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc) documentation engine.
      So beyond the standard OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor
      extensions](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).
  - name: OpenAPI Specification
    description: >-
      The goal of The OpenAPI Specification is to define a standard,
      language-agnostic interface to REST APIs which allows both humans and
      computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service
      without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic
      inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand
      and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
      implementation logic. Similar to what interfaces have done for lower-level
      programming, OpenAPI removes the guesswork in calling the service.
  - name: Path Files
    description: >

      * Write each path specification in separate file

      * Filename is mapped to path by replacing `@` with `/`, i.e.
      `user@{username}.yaml` matches to `user/{username}` path
  - name: Component Files
    description: >
      Define reusable components in separate files in the `components` folder.


      * You can create the following subfolders here:
        - `schemas` - reusable [Schema Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#schemaObject)
        - `responses` - reusable [Response Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#responseObject)
        - `parameters` - reusable [Parameter Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#parameterObject)
        - `examples` - reusable [Example Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#exampleObject)
        - `headers` - reusable [Header Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#headerObject)
        - `requestBodies` - reusable [Request Body Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#requestBodyObject)
        - `links` - reusable [Link Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#linkObject)
        - `callbacks` - reusable [Callback Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#callbackObject)
        - `securitySchemes` - reusable [Security Scheme Objects](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.0.md#securitySchemeObject)
      * Filename of files inside the folders represent component name, i.e.
      `Customer.yaml`
  - name: Tag Files
    description: >-
      By using separate markdown documents and using `$ref` pointers to write
      the `description` field for individual `tags` in the root specification
      file, we can compose rich sections of text and arrange them in flexible
      ways. For exmaple...


      ```yaml

      tags:
        # 'Echo' and 'User' are the main paths in the spec
        - name: Echo
          description: Example echo operations
        - name: User
          description: Operations about user
        # Introduction includes some backround that I'd like to include
        # at the beginning of the docs
        - name: Introduction
          description:
            $ref: ./tags/introduction.md
        # This last section I'll include at the end in the appendix
        - name: Markdown Descriptions
          description:
            $ref: ./tags/markdown_ex.md
      # 'x-tagGroups' instructs redoc on how to arrange and order sections

      x-tagGroups:
        - name: Overview
          tags:
            - Introduction
        - name: Operations
          tags:
            - Echo
            - User
        - name: Appendix
          tags:
            - Markdown Examples
      ```


      `markdown_ex.md` includes headers and content in standard syntax, Which
      are inserted as markdown (and can be rendered as HTML) in the bundled
      spec:


      # Table Example


      | Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |

      |----------|:-------------:|------:|

      | col 1 is |  left-aligned | $1600 |

      | col 2 is |    centered   |   $12 |

      | col 3 is | right-aligned |    $1 |
